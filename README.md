# design-patterns

This is a repo to document design patterns that I learned from a Udemy course (<https://www.udemy.com/share/1013nUAEYacF9SR3Q=/>).

The course is on the design patterns designed in the Gang of Four book. This repo also contains any other patterns that I've come to learn.

## Patterns

### SOLID Principles

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open-Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

### Gang of Four Patterns

#### Creational Patterns

Deals with the creation (construction) of objects.
Explicit (constructor) creation vs. implicit (dependency injection, etc.) creation.
Wholesale (single statement) creation vs. piecewise (step-by-step) creation.

- Factories
- Builders
- Prototypes
- Singleton

#### Structural Patterns

Concerned with the structure of classes (e.g. class members).
Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface.
Stress the importance of good API design.

...

#### Behavioral Patterns

The patterns are all different; no central theme.
